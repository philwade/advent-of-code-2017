# Advent of code 2017!

## Here be dragons

Just a warning: I use advent of code mostly for fun and learning, so solutions in here aren't always optimal or "clean".

## Running stuff
Written in F# (with a little Haskell for some days).

To run (.net core 2 required):

    $ cd src/App/
    $ dotnet run
